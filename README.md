# Examdown

> Write your exam with Markdown + AsciiMath, deliver a PDF

I sometimes need to write documents with equations in it. Word is way too
cumbersome to use. LaTeX is awesome but complex. Why not just use the
simplicity of Markdown syntax and intuitiveness of [AsciiMath] ? That's what
this little bash script provides.

## Install

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pldiiw/examdown.git
```

First, check that you have all the dependencies:

```
$ ./check_deps.sh
getopt from util-linux 2.28.2
cmark 0.27.1 - CommonMark converter
wkhtmltopdf 0.12.3.2
vendor/github-markdown-css/github-markdown.css
vendor/MathJax/MathJax.js
```

If the output looks like this, then you have all the dependencies needed.

If `cmark` is missing, two little scripts are provided to help you obtain it.
You can run these two commands to build and install it:

```
$ ./build_cmark.sh
$ sudo ./install_cmark.sh
```

If `wkhtmltopdf` is missing, install it with your favorite package manager,
like `apt`:

```
$ sudo apt install wkhtmltopdf
```

If the two last ones are missing, just run the `get_deps.sh` script.

```
$ ./get_deps.sh
```

Now that you have all the dependencies, run `build.sh` to set up the hierarchy
needed for examdown to work.

```
$ ./build.sh
```

From there, you can run the tests to check that everything is ok:

```
$ ./run_tests.sh
```

If the tests went right, you can now install the hierarchy generated by
`build.sh` to wherever you want to (`/usr/local` for example):

```
$ ./install.sh /usr/local
```

If you installed examdown to some gloomy path, be sure that the `bin` folder
where `examdown` lies is in your `$PATH` variable.  
Check that the installation worked:

```
$ examdown --help
```

You're done!

If you want to uninstall examdown, use the `uninstall.sh` script:

```
$ ./uninstall.sh
```

## Usage

The following syntax is supported in the Markdown files:
 * CommonMark: http://commonmark.org/help/
 * Tables: https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-
 * Strikethrough: https://github.github.com/gfm/#strikethrough-extension-
 * Autolinks: https://github.github.com/gfm/#autolinks-extension-
 * Underlining using `~~`: `~~I'm underlined~~`
 * Equations using AsciiMath:  http://asciimath.org/ -- equations are delimited
   using `$`: `$x^2$`

See [test/test.md](test/test.md) for an example.
